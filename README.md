## Game: It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia Trivia

Description:
For our first project for GA's WDI 6, we were tasked with creating an interactive game from scratch using what we have learned so far about HTML/CSS/JS. While the original constraints ensured that our game had to fall inside the scope and meet the basic requirements of either a Blackjack, Trivia, Concentration, or Flashcards style clone, we had freedom to make our game our own with custom styles/functions/etc.

After originally planning and working on a jeopardy clone, I choose to do a self-scoring trivia game for my favorite tv show: It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia!

The project prompt suggested we break our work down into smaller processes, and I decided that it made sense to schedule my time to try and come up with chunks that I could mostly accomplish in one day, considering we only had three days to work on the project.  At first, I blocked out the project using Trello, following agile software development principles, and went to work writing user stories so I could create a checklist of programmable features. Then the first day I worked on mostly coming up with a page layout, html structure, and basic styling to help provide some
formatting to easily incorporate into my javascript. The next day I worked primarily in JQuery, trying to get the working logic to make my game playable. The last day I planned to do most of my styling and work on refactoring my javascript to work towards a more abstract, object orientated approach.  Despite my best laid plans, in process I found myself changing a lot on the fly. Overall, despite my many mistakes and original roadblocks, the project was a great learning experience both in terms of technologies used and incorporating agile principles in practice, and represents an important lesson in working toward an Minimal Viable Product.

Unsolved Problems: Objected-oriented approach, more abstract logic, working with more advanced CSS properties and psuedo-selectors.
